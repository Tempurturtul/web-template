# Web Template

This is a basic template for new web dev projects.

**Currently includes:**

- Linting of JS and CSS (eslint, stylelint)
- JS module bundling (webpack)
- Importing of CSS in JS (webpack, css-loader, extract-text-webpack-plugin)
- Importing of image files in JS (webpack, file-loader)
- ES6+ support (babel)
- Live-reloading dev server (webpack-dev-server)
